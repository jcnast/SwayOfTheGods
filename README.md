In this project I explored more of how I can animate characters and combine animations+movement along with having things happen on a global scale and using many more aprticle systems.

The main basis of this game is that it is a MOBA and very much capture-the-flag esque. The idea is to have two teams of about 5 people (similar to League of Legends), but rather than regular capture the flag, there are gods that must be caught. Each god has it's own moves (in this version shown by what happens when they hit you and the way they move).

Ideally, the character's will also have their own unique moves and be customizable, but I worked with just a single character to get the basis of this type of game creation down.

In this game, you are able to kill each of the gods using you abilites, but make sure they do not kill you! (although if they do, you will respawn in 5 seconds). As you kill more gods, the score (shown by the particles in the middle of the map will start to count in your favour - you are on the red team. The more gods you kill, the faster your points count up!

**************************

There are supplied documents for windows, mac and linux (only the windows has been tested currently)

w-a-s-d to move

q and mouse-location for ranged AOE attack

e for local AOE attack

left-click to attack (has a very small attack range - you will probably get hurt when trying to use it)

*If you die you WILL RESPAWN in 5 seconds

You are on the red team, kill gods and watch you score count up! (score shown by particles in the middle of the map - in the
sky)

More gods = faster point gain

Winning = FIREWORKS! (... well... firework)

you will need both the SotG_ [your_ os_ here] file and the SotG_ [your_ os_ here]_Data folder in the same location to play the game.

*run in windows mode as there is no UI for exiting or anything
