This could well be a branch of Geometric Combat, and probably should be. 

In this project I explored more of how I can animate characters and combine animations+movement.

The goal was to make Geometric Combat happen with real people because as I got better at Unity (however slightly) I wanted
the games to be more complex. This project also served as a slap-in-the-face-reminder that complexity is not everything.
I will probably continue with geometric combat before this, as I want to be a programmer, and not a model-developer (how I
wish I could be both effectively- sadly I am very minimally artistic).
